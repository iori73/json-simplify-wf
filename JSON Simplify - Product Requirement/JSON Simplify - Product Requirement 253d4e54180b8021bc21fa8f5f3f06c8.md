- It will simplify working with JSON when developers are dealing with large, messy JSON.

### 👤 User Personas

---

> *Who are you building this for?*
> 
- Web Engineers, who are completely relying on the web for dealing with JSON.
- Student, Instructor, Tutor can use too.

### 🖥️ User Stories

---

> *Written from the user's perspective.*
> 

Examples:

- As a user, I want to paste a large JSON file so that I can view it in a structured, readable way.
- As a user, I want to collapse and expand JSON nodes so that I can easily navigate nested data.
- As a user, I want to search within JSON so that I can quickly find keys or values.
- As a user, I want to select the particular key and finally get the path and copied it so that I can easily use it anywhere.
- As a user, I want to beautify or minify JSON so that I can prepare it for debugging or production.
- As a developer, I want to validate JSON against a schema so that I can ensure my data matches requirements.
